#  MutRoSe-Mission-Decomposer
This is the mission decomposer for the MutRoSe (Multi-Robot systems mission Specification and Decomposition) framework. This decomposer works given: (i) a JSON Goal Model (generated in GODA), (ii) a modified HDDL specification (the original language syntax can be found in [1]), which consists of a subset of the language with the addition of new constructs, (iii) a JSON/XML configuration file and (iv) an XML world knowledge file.

The HDDL parsing part of this software is built upon the PANDA HDDL parser, where the original PANDA HDDL parser code can be found here.
